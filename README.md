# Simple Static Website w/ Laravel Mix

This is an example of the config for a simple static website set up with Laravel Mix, using the standalone setup instructions. BrowserSync configuration also included. You need `yarn`, `npm` and `node`.

## Installation

```
yarn install
yarn run watch
```

## On Windows

I've recently been trying development on Windows. If you are running Windows, I recommend setting up the Windows Subsystem for Linux. You can find more instructions here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/install_guide.

If you're not using WSL, you may encounter issues with the commands (I've had issues with NODE_ENV not working). Depending on the distribution you've chosen, you may need to install `node` and `yarn`.
